Data
====
This repository includes:
a .R file (R script) named on run_Analysis.R 
a pdf file (codebook) named on CodeBook.pdf 

The R script (run_Analysis.R) encompasses the codes for:
reading different pieces of data into R,
combining these pieces to obtain the full large Data (data dimension: 10299*563),
Adding descriptive names for each activity,
fixing unusual featurs of variable names,
subsetting a part of data responsible for variables having mean and standard deviation (data dimension: 10299*88),
calculating the average value of each variable for each subject and each activity and creat new independent data set (data dimension: 180*88),
export the data into a txt file named on "aveData".

the CodeBook.pdf explain how to interpret each variable, the names of variables are also isted and finally some explanation about the data has been represented.
